The first thing that  came to my mind was to make a brainstorm of ideas:</p>

                <p>For the brainstorm, the topic we find the most interesting,  the one we think it could help to make a change and it can help some people in their life is Autonomic high-rise window washer: This has been a project that has called my attention a few days earlier. Just a few days ago, our apartment building was doing window cleaning. When I saw the window washer hanging themselves on the outside of the building to clean the windows of each unit, I was unconsciously worried about them. Even though I knew they were professional and they had enough protection they need.</p>

                <h5>Problem: What is the problem being tackled?</h5>
                <p>To start with this stage, I’ve been researching a lot about the market review for high-rise window washer worldwide. I found that the cost of high-rise window washer is increasing every year from 2010 to 2018. Moreover, according to the International Window Cleaning Association, there had been one high-rise fatality per year in the last four years in the U.S., that’s with an estimated 1.5 million “exposures”-when workers are on the sides of buildings—a year.So based on the current investigation, the problems that need to be solved are the high cost of the high-rise window cleaning and the Safety issues when working at high altitude.</p>

                <p>I decided to identify the target audience through user surveys and online research. Through previous surveys, high-rise window washers are one of my target audiences.
The questions I made in the questionnaire mainly focused on whether the participants needed to clean the windows themselves, the time it takes and is it difficult to clean the windows by themselves. By collecting the answers to the questionnaire, I sorted out two groups of people. People living in the Town House needed to clean the glass of the house themselves and the people living in the apartment because they had a building manager so they did not need to clean the glass themselves.</p>

                <p>After the collected the data from questionnaires, I divided the people who participated in the survey into two categories (people living in the townhouse need to clean their windows by themselves and people live in the apartment, they usually have building managers, and the building manager will be responsible for the window cleaning).
To sum up, my target audience is divided into three categories, people living in Town House, building managers and high-rise window washers.So far I decided that I will interview people from two different professions, building managers and high-rise window washers. I listed some questions that I need to ask during the interview.
My interview with the building manager focused on the time required to complete a window cleaning of the building, the amount of money required to complete a window cleaning of the building, the requirements of the high-rise window washers when the building manager hired the cleaning company, and the preparations required before the building was cleaned etc.

                <p>For high-rise window washers my questions will mainly focus on the safety and time: the risk factors encountered in cleaning the building window, whether the weather will affect the work, the time required to clean a building, as a high-rise window washer what is the most difficult things you encounter when you work? After interviewing with building managers, I found that they had to pay the cleaning company for up to $10,000 each time, and they needed a window cleaning in about 3 months.</p>

                  <p> Saving time and saving money become two of the problems we need to solve. After interviewing with some high-rise window washer, I found that they need to do a lot of safety check before work. The weather will affect the efficiency of work sometimes the change of weather will bring danger to work, finally cleaning takes a long time. So safety issues are a concern for them and saving time also is a problem we need to solve.</p>

In accordance with the scenarios we have discussed, we have produced two different storyboards for this purpose.</p>

              We made a page iteration based on these comments and made a low-fidelity prototype. We took the user's opinion and made another iteration and applied it to the wireframe afterwards. </p>

that the two concepts can be combined and improved, so that the user can could adopt the application into their business and lifestyle.</p>

             <p>To start with I done some research about how to make wireframes. Form my research I know that wireframes are guides to where the major navigation and content elements of my site are going to appear on the page.  I start to create a Low-fidelity wireframe, because it relatively quick to develop and more abstract and implement mock content, it can help our team to communication.</p>

             <p>Base on the feedback I received on my Task 2, I am going to make a high fidelity visual mockups base on my earlier wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes.

         <p>To start with I use SKETCH to create a high-fidelity mockup with my group members, in the process of production, we have improved some problems that have not been discovered before. After making the mockups. At first, we made an interactive prototype by using SKETCH, but we were dissatisfied with the effect until we found a software, InVison studio, we tried to use this software to create the interactive prototype. It took us three days to learn how to use this software. We continued to improve our interactive during the production process, finally, we recorded the walkthrough video with QuickTime Player.</p>
